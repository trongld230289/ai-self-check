# Test GitHub PR Webview Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Added GitHub Patch Parser
- Created `reconstructFromGitHubPatch()` function specifically for GitHub patch format
- GitHub patches use different format than Azure DevOps full git diffs
- Better hunk parsing with @@ markers
- Proper line number tracking

### 2. Enhanced Format Detection
- Detect GitHub format vs Azure DevOps format
- Use appropriate parser based on format
- Fallback to standard git diff parser

### 3. Better Debug Logging  
- Track patch parsing progress
- Show line counts and hunk information
- Debug hunk header parsing

## Expected Results
- GitHub PR diffs should now show actual code content
- Side-by-side comparison should work
- Line numbers should be accurate
- Change indicators should be visible

## To Test
1. Run the GitHub PR again: `@review-pr https://github.com/trongld230289/ng-custom-gantt-chart-v2/pull/6`
2. Click on individual file diff buttons (ðŸ“„ View Diff: index.js)
3. Check console for detailed parsing logs
4. Verify code content appears in webview

## Debug Tips
If still not working, check:
- Console logs for patch parsing details
- Whether hunks are being detected correctly
- Line alignment between original and modified sides
